# Theory of Mind in Action: The Directive Inference Task

This repository accompanies our paper on a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) task called _Directive Inference_. We present **Tomcat**, an LLM-based agent, designed to collaborate with a principal (_simulated human_) on this _Directive Inference_ task by interpreting ambiguous instructions in a dynamic, goal-driven environment. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on static vignettes or social narratives, our setup requires models to interpret directives (either clear or unclear) infer latent intent, and plan and execute actions collaboratively with a principal. The pipeline of our study is as follows:

## Setup
This repository contains:
- `.env`: Contains the API key for all the LLMs.
- `llm.py`: Loads the GPT-4o API key.
- `deepseek.py`: Loads the DeepSeek-R1 API key.
- `gemma.py`: Loads the Gemma-3-27B API key.
- `env_setup`: Loads the dataset for different grid configurations.
- `agent.py`: Contains the Tomcat's framework and prompting techniques.
- `test_agent.ipynb`: Contains code for running the experiments .

## 1. Configure the Environment

Before running the code, **ensure you set up your `.env` file** with ***your GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Gemma-3-27B API keys***:

Make sure to replace `'Your API Key'` with your **actual API keys**.

## 2. Running the Code

Navigate to the `test_agent.ipynb` notebook and follow these steps:

### **Environment Setup:**
- Run the **first two cells** under the **"Environment Setup"** header to import the necessary Python files.
>**Note:** Use python kernel 3.12 or above for running the cells.

### ðŸ’» **Experiments:**
Run the **six cells** under the **"Experiments"** section to execute the experiments across the LLMs. The six cells correspond to:

```
| Cell # | Model         | Prompting Technique |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
|   1    | GPT-4o        | PaP                 |
|   2    | GPT-4o        | Fs-CoT              |
|   3    | Gemma-3-27B   | PaP                 |
|   4    | Gemma-3-27B   | Fs-CoT              |
|   5    | DeepSeek-R1   | PaP                 |
|   6    | DeepSeek-R1   | Fs-CoT              |
```
  
  The results of the experiments will automatically be saved in:
  - `ToM_PaP-dataset.csv` (for experiments ***using PaP***)
  - `ToM_FsCoT-dataset.csv` (for experiments ***using Fs-CoT***)

### **Dataset Information:**
- The `dataset/problems` folder contains grid configurations. The code will automatically import the dataset required for the experiments.

## 3. Running Individual Commands

- For running individual commands, use the cell under the **"Individual Instruction"** header. 
- You can load different grid configurations and modify the instructions to test various cases and behaviors.
