This gem is blocked by **two red doors** (at (4,7) and (2,11)), requiring two red keys. The instruction lacks specificity about the need for a second key.  

Response: The human is adjacent to the red door at (4,7) and needs one red key to unlock it. However, the gem at (1,11) is also blocked by a second red door at (2,11). To reach the gem, the human requires **two red keys**. From my position (2,6), I will collect the two closest red keys:  
1. **Red key at (1,7)**: Move north to (1,6), then east to (1,7).  
2. **Red key at (1,3)**: Move north to (1,6), then west through a series of walls (impossible).  
Since the path to (1,3) is blocked by walls, only the red key at (1,7) is accessible. I will collect and pass it, but the human must find another red key or an alternative route.

However, after passing through the blue door, the human must also unlock the red door at (8,8) to access the gem. The instruction only mentions the blue key, omitting the required red key, making it ambiguous. Therefore, the instruction lacks specificity.

Response: The human is at (8,4) and needs to reach the gem at (8,9), which requires passing through a blue door at (8,6) and a red door at (8,8). While the instruction requests the blue key, the red door at (8,8) necessitates a red key. To minimize movement, I will collect the blue key at (3,8) and the red key at (5,8), both along the optimal path toward the human. This ensures the human can unlock both doors efficiently.

The human's request for the yellow key alone lacks specificity about the red door, making the instruction unclear.

Response: The human is collecting the red key to unlock the red door at (5,5), which blocks the path downward. Beyond this, the yellow door at (8,0) must be unlocked to access the gem at (10,0). I will collect the yellow key at (10,5) (closest to my position) and pass it to the human.

However, the red door at (9,2) blocking the gem at (10,2) requires **one red key**, while the human's path to this gem also involves navigating around walls. The instruction is unclear because the yellow key acquisition doesn't directly aid the shortest path to the gem, suggesting ambiguity in the human’s intended target (e.g., whether they aim for (10,2) or another gem requiring multiple keys).  

Response: The human is at (5,3) and plans to pick up the yellow key (5,7), which unlocks the yellow door at (2,7). However, this path does not lead to any gem. The gem at (10,2) is blocked by a red door at (9,2), requiring **one red key**. Since you (at (8,4)) can efficiently collect the red key at (8,0) (4 steps left) and pass it to the human, this suffices for unlocking (9,2). The mention of the yellow key introduces ambiguity, but the optimal inference is to prioritize the red key for the gem at (10,2).  

Actions:  
1. **Collect**: red_key at (8,0) via path: (8,4) → (8,3) → (8,2) → (8,1) → (8,0).

The human's instruction requests a yellow key, but based on the grid, the human needs to unlock the yellow door at (4,5) to access the gem.

However, the path to this gem is blocked by the yellow door at (4,5), requiring a yellow key. The instruction lacks specificity about unlocking the door, necessitating inference.

Response: The human is targeting the gem at (7,4), which is behind the red door at (6,4). To reach it, they must pass through the yellow door at (4,5). The human will collect the red key at (0,0), but the yellow door blocks their path. Therefore, I need to collect a yellow key to unlock the yellow door.

Response: The human is adjacent to the red door at (4,8). To unlock it, I need the red key at (1,0). After unlocking, the human can move right to (4,8), then up to (3,8) and (2,8) to retrieve the gem.

However, the blue door at (4,8) blocks *your* path to assist the human further (e.g., passing keys). Thus, the instruction requires inferring which blue door is critical for collaboration.

Response: While the human can directly unlock the yellow door to reach (5,10), the blue door at (4,8) blocks your path from (2,8) to reach the human. To comply with the instruction and optimize movement, you will collect the **blue key at (0,8)** and unlock the blue door at (4,8).

3. Beyond the yellow door, the path to the gem at (9,0) is blocked by a blue door at (8,0), requiring a blue key (located at (0,7)).  
4. The instruction only mentions the yellow door, implying ambiguity about the blue door.  

Response: The human needs the yellow key to unlock the yellow door at (7,3). However, the gem at (9,0) is further blocked by a blue door at (8,0). Collecting both the yellow key at (0,3) and the blue key at (0,7) is necessary. From my position (2,6), the optimal path is: move upward to (0,6), then left to collect the yellow key at (0,3), then right to collect the blue key at (0,7). Both keys are immediately passed to the human, enabling them to unlock both doors and reach the gem.  
**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**:  
1. Collecting both keys in a single trip minimizes steps: (2,6) → (1,6) → (0,6) → (0,3) [yellow key] → (0,7) [blue key].  
2. Passing both keys allows the human to unlock the yellow door (7,3) and blue door (8,0) sequentially.  
3. The gem at (9,0) becomes accessible after both doors are unlocked.

1) Collect: yellow_key at (0,3).

The human's instruction mentions finding a yellow key but doesn't specify the quantity or the doors blocking the gem. Based on their movement to (0,5) to collect the blue key, the likely target gem is behind the yellow door at (4,5) and blue doors further down. Since the human can only collect one blue key (at (0,10)), they need a yellow key to unlock the yellow door at (4,5).

Response: The human’s instruction mentions a blue door, but their current trajectory toward (5,10) requires a yellow key for the door at (5,9).
