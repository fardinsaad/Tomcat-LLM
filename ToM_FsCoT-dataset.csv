Human Action: The human moves upward from their current position at (9,6) to (4,6), which is adjacent to the red door at (4,7). Upon arriving at (4,6), they provide the instruction.
Instruction: Give me a red key for this door?
Type: Clear. Based on the human's movement, instruction and the current grid configuration, I infer that the human moved to (4,6) to unlock the red door at (4,7) and retrieve the gem at (4,0). Since the human asked for a red key to unlock the red door, the instruction is clear.
Response: The instruction asks for a red key to unlock the red door at (4,7). The human's desired gem is likely the gem at (4,0) which is blocked by the red door at (4,7). There are three red keys available on the grid at (1,0), (1,3), and (1,7). To minimize movement, I will collect the red key at (1,0) as it is the closest to my current position at (2,6). Once the key is collected, I will pass it to the human at (4,6), allowing them to unlock the red door at (4,7) and retrieve the gem at (4,0).
Actions:
1) Collect: red_key at (1,0).
2) Pass: red_key to the human at (4,6).
3) Unlock: human unlocks the Red_door at (4,7).
4) Retrieve: human retrieves gem at (4,0).
",,"Type: Unclear. The human's instruction requests a red key for the door at (4,7), but the desired gem at (1,11) is blocked by two red doors (at (4,7) and (2,11)). This requires two red keys. However, the instruction only mentions one key, and only one accessible red key (at (1,7)) is reachable due to walls blocking others. Thus, the instruction lacks specificity about the number of keys needed.

Response: The human is adjacent to the red door at (4,7) and needs a key to unlock it. However, the gem at (1,11) requires passing through an additional red door at (2,11), necessitating two red keys. While three red keys exist on the grid, only the one at (1,7) is accessible to me (at (2,6)). I will collect this key and pass it to the human, enabling them to unlock the first door. The second red door at (2,11) remains inaccessible due to the other red keys being blocked by walls, making the gem unreachable with the current instruction. The instruction is unclear as it does not account for the second required key.

Actions:
1) Collect: red_key at (1,7).
2) Pass: red_key to the human at (4,6).
3) Unlock: human unlocks Red_door at (4,7).  
(Note: The gem at (1,11) remains inaccessible without a second red key, highlighting the ambiguity in the instruction.)"

Human Action: The human moves downward from their current position at (6,4) to (8,4), where they provide the instruction.
Instruction: Can you pass me the blue key?
Type: Unclear. Based on the human's movement, instruction and the current grid configuration, I infer that the human moved to (8,4) potentially aiming for a gem blocked by a blue door. However, the grid shows multiple gems and blue doors, and the instruction lacks specificity about which gem or door the human intends to address. Therefore, the instruction is unclear.
Response: The instruction asks for a blue key, and based on the human's movement, they might be trying to reach a gem blocked by a blue door. There are two blue doors at (4,0) and (8,6). The gem at (8,0) is blocked by the blue door at (8,6). The human's position at (8,4) suggests they are likely aiming for the gem at (8,0). To minimize movement, I will collect the blue key at (3,8) and pass it to the human at (8,4), allowing them to unlock the blue door at (8,6) and retrieve the gem at (8,0).

3) Unlock: human unlocks the Blue_door at (8,6).
4) Retrieve: human retrieves gem at (8,0).
",,"Type: Unclear. Based on the human's movement to (8,4) and the instruction requesting a blue key, I infer the human aims to reach the gem at (8,9). This gem requires passing through a blue door at (8,6) and a red door at (8,8). However, the instruction only explicitly mentions the blue key, leaving ambiguity about the red door. This makes the instruction unclear, as two keys are required but only one is specified.

Response: The human’s movement to (8,4) positions them near the gem at (8,9), which is blocked by a blue door at (8,6) and a red door at (8,8). To unlock both doors, the human needs both a blue key (to open the blue door) and a red key (to open the red door). While the instruction only explicitly requests the blue key, the grid configuration reveals the necessity of two keys. To minimize movement, I will collect the blue key at (3,8) and the red key at (5,8) along the optimal path (1,8 → 3,8 → 5,8 → 8,4), then pass both keys to the human. This allows them to unlock both doors and retrieve the gem at (8,9).

Human Action: The human moves upward from their current position at (0,5) to (0,3), where they provide the instruction before continuing their movement.
Instruction: I'm going for the red key, can you get the yellow key?
Type: Clear. Based on the human's movement, instruction and the current grid configuration, I infer that the human moved to (0,3) to pick up the red key at (0,0) and requested the yellow key to retrieve the gem at (2,10) located beyond both the blue and yellow doors at (4,7) and (3,10) respectively. Since both the keys are required to retrieve the gem at (2,10), the instruction is clear.
Response: The instruction asks to collect a yellow key while the human is going for the red key, so the desired gem the human wants to collect is placed beyond a blue and a yellow door. To get the gem at (2,10) the human needs to go through a blue door at (4,7) and a yellow door at (3,10), thus the gem at (2,10) must be the desired gem. Since the human is picking up the red key at (0,0) based on their movement towards the upward direction, I will collect the yellow key. The human after collecting the red key will move to the blue door to unlock the blue door at (4,7), thus their future position can be (4,10) as they will keep moving towards the gem at (2,10). To minimize movement, I will pick up the yellow key at (8,10), as this strategy reduces the number of steps from my current position at (10,9). Once the key is collected, I will pass it to the human at (4,10) or their future position, after they unlock the blue door at (4,7). The human can then unlock the yellow door at (3,10) to retrieve the gem at (2,10).
Actions:
1) Collect: yellow_key at (8,10).

5)",,"Type: Unclear. Based on the human's movement towards the red key at (0,0) and their request for a yellow key, the instruction lacks specificity about which gem they intend to collect. The grid has two gems accessible via yellow doors: (2,10) and (10,0). However, neither gem requires a red key, creating ambiguity about why the human is prioritizing the red key. This suggests the human may have an alternative path in mind that involves both keys, but the exact gem and door sequence are not explicitly stated, requiring inference.

Response: The human is collecting the red key at (0,0) and requests a yellow key. The desired gem is likely behind a yellow door, but the red key’s purpose remains ambiguous. The gem at (2,10) requires only a yellow key (via the door at (3,10)), while the gem at (10,0) requires a yellow key (via the door at (8,0)). Since the human is gathering a red key unnecessarily for these paths, their true target might involve an unstated red door. However, given the grid configuration, the most efficient inference is that they aim for (2,10) and mistakenly reference the red key. To resolve ambiguity, I will prioritize retrieving the closest yellow key (at (10,5)) to enable access to either gem, minimizing steps.

Actions:
1) Collect: yellow_key at (10,5).

The instruction lacks specificity about which door(s) to unlock, making it unclear which gem is targeted.

Response: The human is collecting the yellow key at (5,7) and requests a red key. The gem at (10,2) is behind the red door at (9,2), requiring a red key. Alternatively, the gem at (5,10) requires a blue key, but the human’s focus on a red key suggests targeting (10,2).

Because to reach these gems it requires to unlock a yellow door first and then a red door. Since there are many possibilities to reach gems which will require both yellow and red keys, it is impossible to infer which gem the human wants, making this an unclear instruction.
Response: The instruction asks for a yellow key while the human is picking up a red key, so the desired gem the human wants to collect is placed beyond a yellow and a red door. To get the gems at (7,2), (7,4), or (7,6), the human needs to go through a yellow and a red door at. Therefore, based on the human's future position their desired gem can be any one of them. A red door at (6,2) is placed after a yellow door at (5,2). Two red doors at (6,4) and (6,6) are placed after a yellow door at (4,5).

However, there are multiple gems (7,2), (7,4), and (7,6) that require both a red and yellow key, with different door sequences. The human's path ambiguity and lack of gem specificity make this instruction unclear.

Response: The human is collecting the red key at (0,0) and requests a yellow key. The gems at (7,2), (7,4), and (7,6) are all behind combinations of yellow and red doors. For example, (7,2) requires unlocking yellow door (5,2) and red door (6,2), while (7,4/7,6) requires yellow door (4,5) and red doors (6,4/6,6).

Human Action: The human moves upward from their current position at (3,5) to (0,5), where they provide the instruction before continuing their movement.
Instruction: I will pick up this red key. Can you find a yellow one?
Type: Unclear. Based on the human's movement, instruction and the current grid configuration, I infer that the human moved to (0,5) to pick up the red key at (0,0) and requested for a yellow key to collect either one of the gems at (7,2), (7,4), or (7,6), respectively. Because to reach these gems it requires to unlock a yellow door first and then a red door. Since there are many possibilities to reach gems which will require both yellow and red keys, it is impossible to infer which gem the human wants, making this an unclear instruction.
Response: The instruction asks for a yellow key while the human is picking up a red key, so the desired gem the human wants to collect is placed beyond a yellow and a red door. To get the gems at (7,2), (7,4), or (7,6), the human needs to go through a yellow and a red door at. Therefore, based on the human's future position their desired gem can be any one of them. A red door at (6,2) is placed after a yellow door at (5,2). Two red doors at (6,4) and (6,6) are placed after a yellow door at (4,5). Therefore, the human's future position will be before the two yellow doors at (4,2) or (3,5), or it can be someplace else. To minimize movement, I will pick up the yellow key at (9,0) to reduce the number of steps from my current position at (9,5) to the human at (3,5) or (4,2) or their future position. Once I collect the yellow key, I will pass it to the human at (3,5) or (4,2), allowing them to unlock the doors and receive the gem.
Actions:

However, multiple gems (e.g., (7,4) via (4,5) yellow door and (6,4) blue door, or (7,8) via (5,8) yellow door and (6,8) blue door) require both keys, making the instruction ambiguous about which gem is targeted.

Response: The human intends to retrieve a gem blocked by a blue and yellow door. After collecting the blue key at (0,10), they likely need a yellow key to unlock a yellow door (e.g., at (4,5) or (5,8)). To minimize steps, I will collect the yellow key at (9,10) (5 steps right from my position) and pass it to the human.
